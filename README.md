# HEN-analysis
A Study oriented projected related to HEN analysis.

This report covers the explanation of heat exchange network which exploits excess heat by integrating process hot and cold streams and improves energy efficiency by reducing utility usage and developed a program which performs first law analysis and  pinch analysis on the input stream data and provides the necessary results for inferring the maximum heat recovery and minimum energy consumption in the effort to increase economic feasibility. 

The generic assumptions and heuristics for the mathematical approach to heat exchange network analysis were assumed. Python was used to develop the code using the libraries - Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy and PyPinch. Pinch temperature, hot and cold utility and composite curves were assessed by the code. The mathematics required for building an optimization algorithm for solving the minimum matches problem to find the minimum number of heat exchangers was explained.


# What is HEN-analysis:

> HEN is networks of heat exhangers used to transfer heat from multiple hot streams to multiple cold streams. Heat exchanger network (HEN) is an important > technique for maximizing heat recovery in the industrial chemical process and reducing external heating and cooling utilities.
